## !In Development!

# Back-End
We use `node` version `10.15.0`

```
nvm install 10.15.0
```

```
nvm use 10.15.0
```

The first time, you will need to run

```
npm install
```

Then just start the server with 

```
npm run start
```
It uses nodemon for livereloading :peace-fingers:

# Docker Server
You can run the server using docker.
Just go to mcfadyen/server and run
```
docker-compose up
```

# API Validation
 
 By using celebrate the req.body schema becomes clary defined at route level, so even frontend devs can read what an API endpoint expects without need to writting a documentation that can get outdated quickly.

 ```js
 route.post('/signup', 
  celebrate({
    body: Joi.object({
      name: Joi.string().required(),
      email: Joi.string().required(),
      password: Joi.string().required(),
    }),
  }),
  controller.signup)
 ```

 **Example error**

 ```json
 {
  "errors": {
    "message": "child \"email\" fails because [\"email\" is required]"
  }
 } 
 ```

# Front-End
**still in development, won't run perfectly and has mockups and bugs**

To run the front-end, go to the client folder and run
```
yarn or npm install
```

When packages are all installed, run

```
yarn start or npm start
```
